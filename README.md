# Android/Java application - Table Tennis scoreboard.

This was a project that I undertook while studying at CodeClan, Scotland's Digital Skills academy, but it was a self-driven project that I made in my spare time. I chose the project because in our studio there is a popular Ping Pong table that is frequently used, we'd just finished our Android project and I wanted to try my hand at an independent app.

The app is a work in progress, but at the moment it does what it needs to do: Lets you create players, log scores between players and list those scores in a League Table ranked by percentage win.
